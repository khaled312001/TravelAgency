# Deployment Redirect Fix - Complete Solution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS
**Problem**: The Vercel configuration had a problematic redirect rule that caused infinite redirects:
```json
{
  "source": "/(.*)",
  "destination": "/$1",
  "permanent": false
}
```

**Solution**: Removed the problematic redirect rule and optimized the configuration.

### 2. 403 Forbidden Errors
**Problem**: Domain configuration and static asset handling was causing access issues.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed .htaccess rules to properly handle static assets
- Updated Netlify configuration with proper redirect rules
- Added proper headers for static assets

### 3. Image and Video Loading Issues
**Problem**: Redirect loops were preventing access to static assets.

**Solution**:
- Added specific rules for `/images/**`, `/videos/**`, `/icons/**` paths
- Ensured static assets are served directly without redirects
- Added proper cache headers

### 4. Material Symbols Icon Loading
**Problem**: Icons were failing to load due to redirect issues.

**Solution**:
- Added proper icon configuration in nuxt.config.ts
- Specified icon collections: material-symbols, lucide, heroicons
- Fixed server bundle configuration

## Testing

After deployment, test these URLs:

- https://www.worldtripagency.com/ (should redirect to non-www)
- https://worldtripagency.com/images/packages/destinations/ (images)
- https://worldtripagency.com/videos/hero/desktop/ (videos)
- https://worldtripagency.com/api/packages (API)

## Expected Results

✅ No more ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS errors
✅ No more 403 Forbidden errors
