## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Build the Site
```bash
npm install
npm run generate
```

### 2. Upload to GoDaddy
1. Go to GoDaddy File Manager
2. Navigate to `public_html` folder
3. Delete all existing files
4. Upload all contents from the `dist` folder
5. Upload the `.htaccess` file to `public_html`

### 3. Test the Site
- Visit `https://worldtripagency.com/`
- Test all pages and functionality
- Check contact forms work (they store in Supabase)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What Works:
- ✅ Static pages and routing
- ✅ Supabase database integration
- ✅ Contact forms (store data in database)
- ✅ Multi-language support
- ✅ PWA features
- ✅ Package and destination pages

### What Doesn't Work (GoDaddy Limitation):
- ❌ Server-side API routes
- ❌ Twilio WhatsApp notifications (stored in DB only)
- ❌ Server-side authentication (admin panel limited)

### Alternative Solutions:
If you need server-side features, consider:
1. **Vercel** (recommended for Nuxt)
2. **Netlify**
3. **Railway**
4. **DigitalOcean App Platform**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you still get 403 errors:
1. Check file permissions (644 for files, 755 for folders)
2. Ensure `.htaccess` is uploaded to `public_html`
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check GoDaddy hosting logs

### If pages don't load:
1. Verify all files from `dist` are uploaded
2. Check `.htaccess` rewrite rules
3. Test Supabase connection

## 📞 Support
The site should now work correctly on GoDaddy hosting. All static functionality will work, and contact forms will store data in your Supabase database.
